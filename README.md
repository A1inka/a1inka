I'm a beginner back-end developer. I'm skilled in a variety of technologies, including Kotlin, Java and Python. 
💥 I can write clean code that is easy to understand, which is very important when reading the code and making changes to it by other developers.
🤔 Problem-solving is one of my strengths, and I enjoy tackling challenging coding issues and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.
🌟 Collaboration is key to my approach, and I thrive in team environments where I can learn from my peers and contribute to a shared vision.
